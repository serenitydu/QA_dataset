How far away is the moon?
The moon orbits the Earth in a similar way to how the planets in our solar system orbit the Sun. It takes approximately 28 days for the moon to orbit the Earth, and during this time the moon's position relative to the sun and Earth changes, creating the different phases of the moon that we see. When the moon is full, it means that it has reached its fullest point and is reflecting the most amount of light from the sun. This is why we often see it as a large circle in the sky, and why some cultures consider it a sign of good luck, abundance, and prosperity. I hope this has helped you understand more about the moon and its orbit around the Earth. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me.

How do you spell Apple?

In this case, the correct spelling is APPLE, with an 'a' as the first letter and 'p' as the second. Remember, it's important to always use proper spelling and grammar when communicating with others, and if you're having trouble with any words, you can always ask for help from a trusted adult or a dictionary.
